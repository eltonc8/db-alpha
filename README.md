## Dashboard Alpha - an investment tool to help everyone be a better investor

### features
Dashboard Alpha is an investment tool partially inspired by seekingAlpha.com. It is a tool that aims to help everyone be a better investor by conveniently gathering data and news of a company into one dashboard page.
As emotions can be one of the biggest challenge to an investor (selling into panic, then buying into euphoria, for example), one of the most helpful process to an investor is that of journaling or writing down ideas. Dashboard alpha provides that tool to write down company or idea specific notes.

#### MarketBoard

The Market Board, modeled after the Nasdaq Board, is an convenient way to navigate to different companies' or securities' pages. It also shows the most recent price movements and today's changes. Boards include the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and S&P 500 sectors (as used by the SPDR Sector Select ETFs).
This board makes the day's changes and the most recent live changes visual in a striking manner. It is an application of the idea that making data more accessible and as part of our ambience may help us 1) know the events, 2) think more analytically when looking into the details.

The Market Board features automatic resizing to best present the large volume of data. Rows divide the displays into horizontal sections. THe Board distribute the tickers to each row to make the widest, fitting rectangle or use the fewest rows. If the window cannot accomodate the number of tickers, then each of these rows has a marquee feature that rotates new tickers into the view. Each row will halt if a mouse hovers over it. The marquee features are staggered with different periods for a more visually appealing transition.

#### Securities Dashboard
The Securities Dashboard gathers the most recent news. It also acts as a portal with links to companies' website, SEC filings, etc.
The entries and notes-making tool is also located on this page.

#### Investor's Dashboard
This page is meant to be a quieter page, a page showing all of the investor's notes. Here, an investor can gather her thoughts and see all the thoughts that she wrote.
